# Deploy a sample containerized application on a Nginx server using AWS App Runner.
## Overview
In this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy a sample containerized application on a Nginx server using AWS App Runner.

AWS App Runner is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to quickly deploy containerized web applications and APIs, at scale and with no prior infrastructure experience required. Start with your source code or a container image. App Runner automatically builds and deploys the web application and load balances traffic with encryption. App Runner also scales up or down automatically to meet your traffic needs.

## What you will accomplish
Create a container image for your web app
Push the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry
Create an AWS App Runner service
Clean up your resources

## Prerequisites
Before starting this tutorial, you will need:

An AWS account: if you don't already have one follow the Setup Your Environment tutorial.
AWS Command Line Interface installed and configured. 
Docker Engine installed, and the application started.
Visual Studio Code installed. 

## What is NGINX?
NGINX is a web server and reverse proxy server primarily used to serve static content (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript files), handle HTTP requests, and manage traffic to backend services or applications. It’s known for being fast and efficient at handling many concurrent connections.

NGINX is often used to:

Serve static files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Load-balance requests across multiple servers.
Act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests to backend services.
Improve performance with caching.
Enhance security by managing access and acting as a firewall in some configurations.
For example, if you have an Angular app (or any other frontend framework) and a backend API, NGINX can host your Angular app’s static files and forward API calls to your backend server.

## Implementation

### Step 1: Create a Container Image

In this step, you will create a container image of a sample web app.

1. In a new terminal window, run the following commands to create a new folder called nginx-web-app, and navigate to the folder.
	```
	mkdir nginx-web-app
	cd nginx-web-app
	```
2. On your local machine, navigate to the Visual Studio Code application, and open the nginx-web-app folder.

3. In the Explorer section, select the +New file icon, and enter index.html for the file name.

4. Select the index.html file, and update it with the following code. Then, save the file.
	```
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
	<title>Sample Web App</title>
	<style>
	html { color-scheme: light; }
	body { width: 35em; margin: 0 auto;
	font-family: Amazon Ember, Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; }
	</style>
	</head>
	<body>
	<h1>Welcome to AWS App Runner!</h1>
	<p>If you see this page, the nginx web server is successfully installed and
	working. Further configuration is required.</p>

	<p><em>Thank you for using AWS App Runner!</em></p>
	</body>
	</html>
	```

5. Create another file named Dockerfile, and update it with the following code. Then, save the file.
```
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 nginx:latest
WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY index.html index.html
```

6. In the open terminal window, run the following command to create container image.

docker build -t nginx-web-app .

7. Check local your application.
docker run -p 8080:80 nginx-web-app   

http://localhost:8080/


###  Step 2: Push Container Image to Amazon ECR
In this step, you will create a private repository in Amazon ECR and push the container image you built in previous module to the newly created repository.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management console in a new browser window, and open the Amazon Elastic Container Registry at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/home.

2. For Create a repository, choose Create.

3. On the Create repository page, for Repository name enter nginx-web-app, leave the default selections, and select Create repository.

4. Once the repository has been created, select the radio button for the repository, and then select View push commands

5. Follow all the steps in the pop-up window, to authenticate and push the image to the repository.


###  Step 3: Create an AWS App Runner Service
In this module, you will create an AWS App Runner service using the container image you built in previous module.

1. Sign in to the AWS Management console in a new browser window, and open AWS App Runner at https://console.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/home.

2. Then, choose Create an App Runner service.

3. In the Source and deployment section, leave the default selections for Repository type and Provider. For Container image URI, select Browse.

4. In the pop-up window, for Image repository, select nginx-web-app, and choose Continue.

5. In the Deployment settings section, for ECR access role, select Create new service role, and choose Next.

6. On the Configure service page, for Service name enter nginx-web-app-service, and change the Port to 80. Leave the rest as default, and select Next.

7. On the Review and create page, review all inputs, and choose Create & deploy. 

8. It will take several minutes for the service to be deployed. You can view the event logs for progress.

9. Once the status updates to Running, choose the default domain name URL to view the web app.

10. The Welcome page and confirmation message should look like the image on the right.  


###  Step 4: Clean up Resources
In this step, you will go through the steps to delete all the resources you created throughout this tutorial. It is a best practice to delete resources you are no longer using to avoid unwanted charges.

1. In the AWS App Runner console, navigate to the nginx-web-app-service, choose Actions, and select Delete.


2. Follow the prompts in the pop-up window to confirm deletion of the service.


3. In the Amazon ECR console, select the radio button next to the nginx-web-app repository, and choose Delete.
