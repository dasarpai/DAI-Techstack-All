## What is Comet.ml
[Comet]((https://www.comet.com/site/)) Automatically track all your prompt engineering work. Run automated evaluations on your LLM responses to optimize your applications before and after they hit production.

Debug and evaluate your LLM applications with Opik (Opik Open Source LLM Evaluation)
- Automatically track all your prompt engineering work. Run automated evaluations on your LLM responses to optimize your applications before and after they hit production.


Track and visualize your model training runs with Experiment Management (Commet Experiment Management)
- Log all your machine learning iteration to a single system of record. Make it easy to reproduce a previous experiment and compare the performances of training runs.

Monitor ML model performance in production with Comet MPM (Commet Model Monitoring)
- Track data drift on your input and output features after your model is deployed to production. Set customized alerts to capture model performance degradation in real time.

Store and manage your models with Model Registry (Commet Model Registry)
- Create a centralized repository of all your model versions with immediate access to how they were trained. Promote models to downstream production systems with webhooks

Create and version datasets with Artifacts (Commet Artifacts)
- Know which exact dataset version a model was trained on for auditing and governance purposes. Leverage remote pointers to reference data already stored in the cloud. 

## Experiments Run
To reduce the friction caused by disconnected ML tech stacks and to help companies realize value from ML, Comet focuses on the three core elements of development: 
- experiment management, 
- model management, and 
- production monitoring. 

Cometâ€™s highly customizable ML development platform allows data scientists and engineers to manage and optimize models across the entire ML lifecycle in a single user interface.


Comet provides an end-to-end model evaluation platform for AI developers, with best in class LLM evaluations, experiment tracking, and production monitoring.
